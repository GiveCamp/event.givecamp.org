Thank you for your interest in the Michigan Give Camp in Ann Arbor.  We regret to inform you that we 
will not be able to assist your organization.  We had an amazing response of non-profits requesting 
assistance, and there are only so many developer volunteers.  

Your organization supports a worthy cause.  We hope that you will apply again next year.  

Thanks!
